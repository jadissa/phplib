Description
You should not have written any code yet ;)
The aim of this project is to speed development for PHP related applications

Installation
Create your project folder first.
cd /this/phplib/
composer install

Setup
Your project should define an entry point at its root such as index.php.
The beginning of your entry point should contain the following PHP code:
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/nikken1/phplib/src/NikkenPHPLib/Fw.php';
use NikkenPHPLib\Fw;
try
{
    $settings = Fw::getSettings();
    if (empty($settings))
    {
        throw new Exception('Settings cannot be determined');
    }
}
catch(Exception $e)
{
    die($e->getMessage());
}
